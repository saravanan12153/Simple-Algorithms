/*
Create a function that accepts a number as an input parameter.
Return an array that counts down by one, from the number (as the arrayâ€™s
first element) down to 0 (as the last element).  How long is this array?

/*
console.log(eQuestOne(5));
would log '[5,4,3,2,1,0]'
The array will be (numb+1) in length.
