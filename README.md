# Simple-Algorithms (Javascript solutions)
I'm learning to code!  This repository is a collection of algorithm problems and how I solved them using Javascript.

This repository is organized into chunks of 4-5 algorithm challenges per folder.  The lower the number, the earlier the question and thus the easier the challenge.

These problems are completely solved in javascript.  When I move on to different languages, I intend to solve these same problems but in the new language.  Hopefully it’ll work as a rosetta stone for me making it easier and faster for me to learn new languages.  We shall see.

# And a thank you…
I want to thank Coding Dojo Seattle for the night class that gave me the confidence to really pursue web development as a career.  I only took an evening class and it certainly didn’t prepare me for everything, but the emphasis on algorithms and and web structures has helped demystify the industry.  I still have much to learn, but the confidence I gained has helped me make great strides on my own.

This isn’t an endorsement, but it was certainly what I needed to gain momentum.  Maybe it can help you as well.
