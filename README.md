# Simple-Algorithms (Javascript solutions)
I'm learning to code!  This repository is a collection of algorithm problems and how I solved them using Javascript.

This repository is organized into chunks of 4 algorithm challenges per folder.  The lower the number, the earlier the question and thus the easier the challenge.

These problems are completely solved in javascript.  When I move on to different languages, I intend to solve these same problems but in the new language.  Hopefully itâ€™ll work as a rosetta stone for me making it easier and faster for me to learn new languages.  We shall see.
